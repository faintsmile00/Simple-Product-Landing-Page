# Simple-Product-Landing-Page
A simple product landing page, for context it was made as satire to share within my friend group, and makes reference to a video game we all play.

Makes use of CSS styling to create some simple yet practical features, such as elements that enlarge/change color on hover, and a navbar that remains fixed to the top of the page.

Contains features relevant to the creation of a product landing page, including a review section, various pricing options and a promotional video.

Embedded YouTube video was made as satire to promote the fictional service being advertised, and is edited in a simplistic way to provide a short and entertaining video for visitors.
